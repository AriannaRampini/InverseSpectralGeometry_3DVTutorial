# Inverse Spectral Geometry

In ```3DV2021_Tutorial_ShapeFromSpectrum.ipynb``` you can find a tutorial on how to recover shape deformations from the LBO spectrum using standard PyTorch autodifferentiation tools.

This is part of the [3DV 2021 Tutorial](https://3dv2021.surrey.ac.uk/tutorials/) "Spectral Geometry in practice".
